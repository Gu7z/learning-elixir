# Bin2dec

Idea from [app-ideas](https://github.com/florinpop17/app-ideas)

- [x] User can enter up to 8 binary digits in one input field
- [x] User must be notified if anything other than a 0 or 1 was entered
- [x] User views the results in a single output field containing the decimal (base 10) equivalent of the binary number that was entered

# Add tests

If you want to test this just put a new test at `/test/bin2dec_test.exs`
